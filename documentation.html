<h4>Design Process</h4>
<p>For this project we utilized a dataset containing Madden 23 player ratings. Each entry of the dataset is a current NFL player, and there are 2368 entries. There is also a total of 80 columns in the dataset with information pertaining to the player. Some columns are basic information such as full name and team. The majority of columns are the different ratings for each player that are on a scale from 0-99. From this dataset, we generated many questions. We set out to answer them by creating this project. When designing these visualizations, we wanted to show the wide range that players in Madden could be rated and to show where most players were rated. We decided it was best to show this not only using rating but also using physical attributes such as height and weight to show the different types of bodies that can be in the NFL. Finally, we wantd to show how teams stacked up against each other and to see if better teams had a higher amount of higher rated players.</p>


<h4>Design Questions</h4>
<p>Our first questions were what is the distribution of overall rating, and what is the average rating? Our first graph in the upper-left answered this. We used a histogram for the overall rating at each position becuase we wanted to show exactly how many players were given a certain rating. After seeing this histogram it led to another question: what is the distribution for distinct positions and teams? Therefore, we created the dropdown features to filter the two graphs by position and team, respectively. We wanted to show what the most common rating was at each position, and for the team to show if teams that were considered better had better players</p>
<p>Another question we posed was what is the distribution of height and weight for NFL players? How do demographics differ by position? For the Height vs Weight graph we decided on a scatter plot because we wanted to see a distribution across the many different players. This allowed us to see that players with varying heights and weights could make the NFL, as well as how position interacted with height and weight.</p>
<p>Finally, we created the player profile page so we could look at specific ratings of players. This allowed us to display many attributes of each player and explore the dataset further. With this page we answered the question, how does overall rating relate to individual skill ratings? By being able to look at the individual skill ratings compared to the overall rating, we could see how they are impacted by one another.</p>


<h4>Fact Discoveries</h4>
<p>What we learned is that most players in the NFL were rated around 65-70 overall. Also, wide receivers (WR) had the most amount of players rated above 90. Looking at the height vs weight scatter plot, the majority of NFL players weighed in between 170 and 330 pounds and when it came to height, most players were between 74 and 77 inches tall.</p>
