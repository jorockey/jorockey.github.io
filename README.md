# Portfolio Website

This repository is for a portfolio website to display my skills, experience, and past work all in one place. The main page is contained in index.html and there is also an about page title about.html. Additionally, the repository contains copies of my past projects in order to display them properly on the web page. Additional files such as images, CSS styling, etc. are contained in the assets folder.
